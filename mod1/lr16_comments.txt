Daisy's Q:

- Mdyn fine to leave as is. would be too speculative otherwise.

 - didn't add comparison of L_FIR from Bothwell+13 and SED fitting in
   literature. Reason: reported values (Tan+13, R+14) for GN20 are
   L_IR, and I don't want to draw any additional claims based on other
   scaling (e.g. Carilli,Walter+13, scaling by 1.3 between IR and
   FIR). Also I don't want to digress too much in the conclusion by
   commenting this and that on other's work (at least not in this
   particular paper). -- huh??

--------------

abstract last sentence: re-write

intro: pioneering works: add smail+97, hughes+98, barger+98

 "where this companion galaxy is identified" --> re-write

 remove "previous"

 suggested --> suggest


fig 1/2 right: zoom out 10%-15%

fig 2 left stretch not optimal?

fig 3 number labels too small


sect. 4.1: not understandable without introducing params/assumptions

why not SPIRE etc in Tab 2 for completeness?

sect. 4.2: fit model --> models (since deriving best fits from model*S*)

sect 4.3.3: clean up end, txt needs straightening out

--- rather comapre dust sizes of smm0939 to S15, B13, 15 directly?

sect 5:

- state gas mass!

- say that B13 SMGs are 850um-selected & typ unlensed or only weakly
  magnified

- low end of Mgas among SMGs - state possibility of lower CO ex? then
  again, spot on w/ QSO2s

- invert logic of last sentence: first what it is, second what we
  interpret it to be

thank referee in acknowledgments

tab 4: state what thermalized excitation means

throughout: LR15 --> LR16

also: spell-check reply to referee!!
